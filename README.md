ReadmebuildeR
=============

A simple R package to automatically build consistently formated and nicely looking READMEs and simple package websites.

## Installation

```
devtools::install_github("Appsilon/readmebuilder")
```

## How to use it?

Run:

```r
build_readme("examples/README.Rmd", output_md = 'README2.md')
```

and check `examples/README.Rmd` for formatting of Rmd file.

Note **two** things here:

1. This is responsible for selecting folder which will contain all your static images generated by Rmd active R cells.

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  ...
  fig.path = "examples/README_files/"
)
```

To access screenshots of generated active cells include `screenshot.force = TRUE` parameter in cell definition:

```
{r, screenshot.force = TRUE}
```

2. You can manipulate the style of generated `html` file just by adding this line to Rmd file:

```
<link href='style.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

and including `style.css` file in the folder containing your html output.


For more details check the documentation of the `build_readme` function.
